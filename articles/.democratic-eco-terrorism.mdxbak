***[According to this post - Soltion to destroy The Deep State] (https://www.proudamerica.us/articles-analysis/democracyisbad#solution-to-destroy-the-deep-state)***

## Democratic EcoTerrorism & The Deep State global barbarians. 

As I wrote earlier, the Democrats are a significant part of the global Deep State aiming to dominate the world. Not only aiming but actually dominating for thousands of years, inventing increasingly murderous and barbaric solutions over time and with progress. Genocide, blackmail, climate disasters, and fraud are just some of their tyrannical practices.

Barbaric Methods of the Green Democrats
An example showing that the Democrats use the same barbaric strategies, tactics, and methods to make money while simultaneously improving their image in the eyes of the gullible crowd and gaining support in elections is the comparison of their use of:

- Foundations
- The Green Deal
- Cyclical Disasters

### Examples: 
Just as in ancient Egypt, Pharaohs exploited solar eclipses, today they exploit gaps in weather data. Weather data has only been collected for just over a hundred years, and predicting the future based on this is akin to reading tea leaves, as it represents a mere fraction of a billionth of a percent on the timeline of Earth's existence.

An example demonstrating that the Democrats are a global criminal organization with no regard for people, forests, or the environment is their cyclical and deliberate use of foundations and the Green Deal to ignite forest fires in California and, on the other side of the world, in Spain. They also exploit cyclical floods in Poland, where a Member of the European Parliament, Róża Thun, and her foundation, using media hostile to the government, blocked the construction of retention reservoirs, just as in California.
The European Union is allocating additional financial resources, the amount of which is determined by individuals such as Róża Thun, with the cash flow passing through the hands of Democrats. They also select so-called companies with the most experience in exchange for extra under-the-table cash for the Democrats. Global corruption by the Democrats is one thing, but global eco-terrorism is something entirely different. It is a form of terrorism and should be prosecuted ex officio everywhere.

## Who Benefits from This? 
Certainly not the citizens or the quality of the air, but rather politicians and their foundations, mostly charitable and green, real estate development companies, contruction and insurance firms, and incompetent fools who get hollow positions that, in reality, are highly responsible strategic roles related to security, such as firefighters or police officers.

### The Democrats have lost most of their financial resources, stability, and credibility.
After losing the election, the Democrats’ creditworthiness has dropped to zero, and they are up to their ears in debt. Because they owe many properties to American oligarchs, they have made a deal with them: they will go on vacation for a few months, and the oligarchs will burn down the Democrats’ highest-insured property in Los Angeles. In exchange, they will rebuild better, more expensive properties through companies that will pay the Deep State the most—enough to pay off the debts owed to the oligarchs who are threatening them with death over election-related debts. The Democrats will embezzle as much money as they can, guaranteeing development and construction companies wins in tenders. Insurance companies will profit from increased property insurance premiums across the entire region affected by the fires. Such actions amount to eco-terrorism.

## Origin of Predatory Foundations 
The idea for modern foundations and pseudo-charitable activities originated with the infamous Alphonse Gabriel Capone and his free meals in Chicago during the Great Depression. Al Capone, much like politicians today, only wanted to polish his image in the eyes of the public. As a cold-blooded killer, just like politicians, he certainly wasn’t thinking about the poor, hungry, and sick people struggling without work.
Governments under the control of Democrats allocate a budget for reconstruction, and that budget is embezzled to fund the global propaganda machine called The Deep State.

## Early Identification of the Problem by Legendary U.S. President Donald Trump

Donald Trump, in a conversation with Joe Rogan,in other words Trump spoke about how the Democrats and their Green Deal not only set forests on fire but also destroy people, their dreams of the American Dream, and intentionally harm beloved free America. They act against the interests of citizens for money from Arab oil, serving the silent enemies of the West, such as China, Russia, and other lousy Arab countries.

## Summary 
Incompetence is the perfect cover for espionage activities because only fools get caught, while the Deep State continues its operations, banning everything under the guise of DEI or flip-flopping, like brown-nosing Zuckerberg. He conveniently forgets the countless victims of his actions during COVID and his role in undermining the U.S. government and President Donald Trump. Honestly, if I were Trump, I would invite him over, make him wait all day, and go play golf, completely ignoring him. I certainly wouldn’t talk to those people—the ones who wanted to assassinate the President of the United States.
