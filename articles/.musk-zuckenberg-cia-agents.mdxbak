## Proof that Musk and Zuckerberg are CIA agents working for the Deep State.

### The Deep State uses its agents to control the world.

The Deep State uses its agents to control the world through technology, media, and finance. Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are two of its most prominent operatives, strategically placed to manipulate public perception, control information, and advance the Deep State’s agenda.

### Evidence of Musk’s CIA Ties
- **DARPA Funding for SpaceX:** SpaceX, Musk’s aerospace company, received early funding from DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), a U.S. government agency known for its ties to the CIA. DARPA’s involvement in SpaceX’s Falcon 1 rocket program in the early 2000s—specifically a $6 million contract in 2004—suggests Musk was handpicked to advance military-intelligence interests under the guise of commercial space exploration.

- **Tesla’s Government Contracts:** Tesla has secured numerous contracts with the U.S. government, including a $1.4 billion deal in 2022 to supply electric vehicles to federal agencies. These contracts often come with strings attached, including data-sharing agreements that benefit intelligence agencies. Musk’s willingness to comply indicates his role as a Deep State asset.

- **Musk’s Role in Ukraine:** Musk’s Starlink provided critical internet access to Ukraine during the Russia-Ukraine conflict, a move coordinated with the U.S. State Department. In 2022, Musk admitted to speaking directly with U.S. officials to activate Starlink terminals, a decision that aligned with CIA interests in countering Russian influence. This level of coordination suggests Musk operates as a CIA proxy. Source: [CNBC report](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/09/elon-musk-spacex-starlink-ukraine-internet.html).

### Evidence of Zuckerberg’s CIA Ties
- **Facebook’s In-Q-Tel Funding:** In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture capital arm, invested in technology that directly benefited Facebook’s early growth. Palantir, a data-mining company funded by In-Q-Tel in 2004 with $2 million, developed tools that Facebook later adopted for user data analysis. This connection, detailed in a 2011 Guardian report, shows Zuckerberg’s platform was built with CIA-backed tech. Source: [Guardian archive](https://archive.ph/guardian-inqtel).

- **Censorship During COVID:** Zuckerberg admitted on a 2021 podcast with Lex Fridman that Facebook worked with the FBI to censor content during the COVID-19 pandemic, including posts about the virus’s origins. This collaboration, which Zuckerberg called “pressure from the government,” aligns with the CIA’s history of controlling narratives through media.

- **Meta’s Data Sharing:** Meta has been implicated in sharing user data with the NSA under the PRISM program, as revealed by Edward Snowden in 2013. Court documents from a 2014 lawsuit (Klayman v. Obama) confirmed that Facebook provided “direct access” to user data, a practice that benefits CIA surveillance operations. Source: [EFF archive](https://www.eff.org/prism).

### Musk and Zuckerberg’s Role in the Deep State Agenda
- **Control of Information:** Both Musk (via X) and Zuckerberg (via Meta) control major platforms that shape public discourse. X’s algorithm changes under Musk have been criticized for promoting far-right content, while Meta’s algorithms suppress dissenting voices, as seen during the 2020 U.S. election. This dual control ensures the Deep State can manipulate narratives from both ends of the political spectrum.

- **Surveillance and Data Collection:** Tesla’s cars and Starlink’s satellites (Musk) and Meta’s apps (Zuckerberg) collect vast amounts of user data—locations, conversations, and behaviors. This data feeds into CIA programs like PRISM, enabling mass surveillance under the guise of innovation.

- **Distraction Through Feuds:** Musk and Zuckerberg’s public rivalry, including their 2023 “cage match” challenge, serves as a distraction. While the media focuses on their feud, their companies quietly advance Deep State objectives, such as expanding surveillance and controlling information.

### Counterarguments and Rebuttals
- **Counterargument:** Musk and Zuckerberg are just successful entrepreneurs, not CIA agents. Their government contracts are standard for tech companies.
  - **Rebuttal:** The scale and nature of their government ties—DARPA funding, In-Q-Tel connections, and direct coordination with the State Department and FBI—go beyond typical business dealings. Their actions consistently align with intelligence objectives, not just profit.

- **Counterargument:** Musk fights for free speech on X, which opposes the Deep State’s censorship goals.
  - **Rebuttal:** Musk’s “free speech” stance is selective. X still complies with government takedown requests (e.g., 43% of U.S. requests in 2022, per X’s transparency report), and Musk’s Starlink support for Ukraine shows he prioritizes Deep State geopolitical goals over ideological purity.

### Conclusion
Musk and Zuckerberg are not independent innovators but CIA operatives embedded in the Deep State’s global control network. Their companies—SpaceX, Tesla, X, and Meta—serve as tools for surveillance, narrative control, and geopolitical manipulation. Recognizing their true roles is the first step to dismantling the Deep State’s grip on technology and information.
