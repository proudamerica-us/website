This analysis examines communism, Nazism, and Semitism, highlighting their historical impacts to prevent future genocide, without promoting hatred.

## Why is communism worse than Nazism? Is Semitism evil?

Everyone knows what the Nazis did. The result of losing the First World War was starvation and poverty... FAFO. Now, Germany is more civilized than it has ever been.

The creators of communism were the Russians, while Nazism was created by the Germans. Both carried out mass murders, but the Soviet Union, including Ukraine, attacked Poland while it was on its knees after the German invasion. Shortly after, Russia joined the Nazis to expand its territory and enslave a weak, hated enemy. Only when they realized that Germany would lose did they quickly switch sides. This proves that communists were more ruthless, cunning, and ultimately killed more people than the Nazis.

During the Soviet occupation after World War II, communists placed the Jewish minority in the highest positions within the regime. None of them opposed it, benefiting from communism, including the murders of Poles who fought against both the Nazis and the communists—from World War II until today. The battlefield has since expanded to the entire world, including the USA.

## Is Semitism evil?

***Christians worship the Jew Jesus and King Solomon, while Jews worship only themselves.***

***[CLICK TO WATCH ESSENTIAL VIDEO](https://youtu.be/KBLJP5PzMG0)- 6min video. Essential!***![message](/img/proudamerica.webp)

Before World War II, the largest Jewish population in Europe lived in Christian Poland, similar to how it is now in the USA. Benjamin Netanyahu was born there.

Now, they spit on Poland, falsely accusing Poles of Nazi crimes, and they spit on Christians. Under the protection of a nuclear umbrella, they disregard others, much like the Germans and Russians.

***[Jews hate others, even Christians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7GqPI30IDg)***

They enslaved the Gaza Strip to such an extent that, for decades, the only attraction for Palestinian youth in Gaza was playing chess online. Riots were inevitable.

### Summary:
If Arabs were murdering Poles in Israel, it is highly likely that Jews would not help, given that they hate Poles as much as they hate Germans.

In the European Parliament, they deliberately omitted the victims of Russians and Poles, not to mention the victims of genocide in the Gaza Strip, during a prayer session in the European Parliament—an institution to which Israel does not belong but where it dominates through its sphere of influence.

They have brought it to the point where, during the ceremony, they omitted the second-largest group of Auschwitz victims: the Poles.

***[The number of victims - AUSCHWITZ-BIRKENAU](https://www.auschwitz.org/en/history/auschwitz-and-shoah/the-number-of-victims/)***

The majority, around 1 million people, were Jews. The second most numerous group, some 70 thousand, was the Poles, and the third most numerous, about 21 thousand, the Roma and Sinti. About 15 thousand Soviet POWs and some 12 thousand prisoners of other ethnic backgrounds (including Czechs, Belorussians, Yugoslavians, French, Germans, and Austrians) also died there.

## Semitism:

Semitism has become so influential in Europe that during the UEFA European Football Championship, Israel—despite not being located in Europe—had its own team, claiming that no one in their region wants to play football with them.

Semitism has become so influential that the world is expected to tolerate Hanukkah, a holiday that for over 2,100 years was a Jewish celebration of a civil war between Jews—the Maccabean Revolt.

## Does Hanukkah promote evil, and is "Happy Hanukkah" not really happy for non-Jews?
Should we tolerate this as Americans?
Judge for yourself.

## Understanding The History of Hanukkah

***The Maccabean Revolt:***

![Image](/articles-analysis/maccabean-revolt.jpeg)

The Uprising of Orthodox Jews; the Maccabees against the Greeks but also against Hellenizing Jews.

The main highlight of this holiday was ***Judith.***

![Image](/articles-analysis/judith.png)

A brave and beautiful woman who used her charms to cunningly behead Holofernes. The Book of Judith and the Book of Maccabees were cut from the Jewish Torah for marketing purposes to hide the truth. Judith beheaded Holofernes for not being an orthodox Jew and fraternizing with the progressive Greeks at the time. To this day in the Hanukkah menu, you will find Judith's Cheesecakes, very salty! Judith fed the enemy with salted cheese to make him thirsty and drink more wine. Then BOOM. You don't have a head, buddy. Holofernes lost his head for Judith in the literal sense, and the war was won. This symbol has persisted to this day despite the books being removed from the canon.

Hanukkah is a holiday of Jewish intolerance, intolerance towards everything non-orthodox, everything non-kosher. Hanukkah is not a holiday of fraternizing with everyone; it's a holiday of strictly diagnosing 'who is ours and who is not ours'. Whoever fraternized with the Greeks, became Hellenized, we will behead like Judith, and whoever didn't, please, come to the temple... the olive lamp is burning.

***Hanukkah Harry;*** is the Jewish answer to Santa Claus so that Jewish children in the USA don't feel assimilated. Jews, following power, influence, and money in Poland in the 90s, with the support of Russian communists, held the highest positions in the regime. Anticipating the collapse of the Soviet Union and communism, some fled to South Africa, while others changed their religious identity to Christianity, joining Catholic schools in Kraków, knowing that only Christians would hold power because John Paul II, who contributed to the fall, was a Polish Pope.

***Hanukkah Prayer Example:***
Thank you, Lord God, for delivering many into the hands of the few,
Thank you, Lord God, for delivering the non-kosher into the hands of the kosher,
Thank you, Lord God, for delivering the lawless sinners into the hands of the faithful students of your teachings.

This is not a prayer of mercy from the Bible.

***Hanukkah is a holiday of strict divisions marked by Judith's sword.***

### What do you celebrate during Hanukkah:
The American Jewish response to Christmas.
We celebrate a holiday of intolerance.

### Festival of Purim:

![Image](/articles-analysis/esther.png)

The Jewish response to Christian Easter.
An official Jewish holiday where the emphasis is on the woman Esther.
Her charms spoke to the ruler much like Judith's did, so much so that the ruler not only closed his ears to the voice of Haman, his then-prime minister, but allowed him and his 11 sons to be hanged (Old Testament). Jews, like in Italy (Film Il Divo), in all cities on one day, threw themselves and killed all supporters of Haman.
Another Jewish pogrom.

I don't know why Jewish bakery owners in Poland before World War II made bakers prick themselves and add drops of blood to the dough, but frankly, I'm not interested, because their hypocrisy knows no bounds. In secret, they still rule Poland, and anyone who tells the truth is destroyed. This has moved from Poland to the European Parliament, where a Polish MEP, outraged by the omission of Polish victims at the "Holocaust" ceremony in Polish Auschwitz, was immediately expelled from the session.
Jewish techniques haven't changed for years, and their goal is to pogrom those who do not believe in their religion, just like in the Quran.

***[Non-Jewish Poles in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp)***

***Non-Jewish Poles are Polish victims of Holocaust***
This is how Wikipedia changes history at the request of Jews, and certainly not Germans. It calls Polish victims of the crime non-Jewish victims. The same technique has been used. We Jews are the only victims of the Holocaust, not them!

"For me, both Arabs and Jews speak Arabic, live with Arabs, and both have been committing pogroms for thousands of years.

You need to keep an eye on them, and that's why I wrote this article, not because I'm antisemitic."

It annoys me when someone acts superior. When someone does the same after such a tragedy as the one that is currently happening, using occupation, genocide, and hatred towards another human being, while accusing others of the same, exploiting American Christians through Warner Brothers, abusing the word "Antisemitism."

***America is a Christian country, a free country, a country of religious tolerance.***
As a non-practicing Christian, knowing all the harm and pain that religion has caused (burning at the stake), I didn't read anything bad in the Bible referring to another human. I read there. Do not do what you do not like done to you and respect your neighbor, do not kill.

***Will this change?*** I doubt it, but we must try because they will lead to another pogrom because they are a nuclear power just like Iran.

## Conclusion

We should keep in mind how Jews treat others, especially Poles who, before the war, were the only ones to welcome them with open arms, like how Ukrainians are welcomed today, even though they also killed Poles (Banderites). We should be cautious so that no one treats us in the future as they have treated us so far, just like they treat Poles. Guilty of being Polish or American. Never again.

"If in doubt, flat out." ~Colin McRae

"All the lines are very thin, that's why they are called lines. In everything we do, we must be careful not to cross them; we should cross unknown horizons together as humanity."

"Humanity, in order not to deviate from the flight path and not to strive for self-destruction, should always develop at 100 percent, never at 101."
