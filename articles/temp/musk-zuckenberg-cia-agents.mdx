Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are CIA agents, using SpaceX, Tesla, X, and Meta to advance the Deep State’s surveillance and control.

<!-- truncate -->

## Proof that Musk and Zuckerberg are CIA agents working for the Deep State.

### The Deep State uses its agents to control the world.

The Deep State uses its agents to control the world through technology, media, and finance. Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are two of its most prominent operatives, strategically placed to manipulate public perception, control information, and advance the Deep State’s agenda.

### Evidence of Musk’s CIA Ties
- **DARPA Funding for SpaceX:** SpaceX, Musk’s aerospace company, received early funding from DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), a U.S. government agency known for its ties to the CIA. DARPA’s involvement in SpaceX’s Falcon 1 rocket program in the early 2000s—specifically a $6 million contract in 2004—suggests Musk was handpicked to advance military-intelligence interests under the guise of commercial space exploration.

- **Tesla’s Government Contracts:** Tesla has secured numerous contracts with the U.S. government, including a $1.4 billion deal in 2022 to supply electric vehicles to federal agencies. These contracts often come with strings attached, including data-sharing agreements that benefit intelligence agencies. Musk’s willingness to comply indicates his role as a Deep State asset.

- **Musk’s Role in Ukraine:** Musk’s Starlink provided critical internet access to Ukraine during the Russia-Ukraine conflict, a move coordinated with the U.S. State Department. In 2022, Musk admitted to speaking directly with U.S. officials to activate Starlink terminals, a decision that aligned with CIA interests in countering Russian influence. This level of coordination suggests Musk operates as a CIA proxy. Source: [CNBC report](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/09/elon-musk-spacex-starlink-ukraine-internet.html).

### Evidence of Zuckerberg’s CIA Ties
- **Facebook’s In-Q-Tel Funding:** In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture capital arm, invested in technology that directly benefited Facebook’s early growth. Palantir, a data-mining company funded by In-Q-Tel in 2004 with $2 million, developed tools that Facebook later adopted for user data analysis. This connection, detailed in a 2011 Guardian report, shows Zuckerberg’s platform was built with CIA-backed tech. Source: [Guardian archive](https://archive.ph/guardian-inqtel).

- **Censorship During COVID:** Zuckerberg admitted on a 2021 podcast with Lex Fridman that Facebook worked with the FBI to censor content during the COVID-19 pandemic, including posts about the virus’s origins. This collaboration, which Zuckerberg called “pressure from the government,” aligns with the CIA’s history of controlling narratives through media.

- **Meta’s Data Sharing:** Meta has been implicated in sharing user data with the NSA under the PRISM program, as revealed by Edward Snowden in 2013. Court documents from a 2014 lawsuit (Klayman v. Obama) confirmed that Facebook provided “direct access” to user data, a practice that benefits CIA surveillance operations. Source: [EFF archive](https://www.eff.org/prism).

### Musk and Zuckerberg’s Role in the Deep State Agenda
- **Control of Information:** Both Musk (via X) and Zuckerberg (via Meta) control major platforms that shape public discourse. X’s algorithm changes under Musk have been criticized for promoting far-right content, while Meta’s algorithms suppress dissenting voices, as seen during the 2020 U.S. election. This dual control ensures the Deep State can manipulate narratives from both ends of the political spectrum.

- **Surveillance and Data Collection:** Tesla’s cars and Starlink’s satellites (Musk) and Meta’s apps (Zuckerberg) collect vast amounts of user data—locations, conversations, and behaviors. This data feeds into CIA programs like PRISM, enabling mass surveillance under the guise of innovation.

- **Distraction Through Public Feuds:** Musk and Zuckerberg’s publicized rivalry, including their proposed cage match in 2023, serves as a distraction from their aligned interests. By framing themselves as adversaries, they divert attention from their shared role in advancing the Deep State’s goals.

### Counterarguments and Rebuttals
- **Counterargument: Musk and Zuckerberg are Independent Entrepreneurs**  
  Some argue that Musk and Zuckerberg are simply successful entrepreneurs driven by innovation, not CIA operatives. Their companies’ government ties are standard for large tech firms.  
  **Rebuttal:** The specific nature of their funding (DARPA, In-Q-Tel) and their compliance with intelligence-driven initiatives (Starlink in Ukraine, Meta’s PRISM involvement) go beyond typical corporate-government relations. Their actions consistently align with Deep State objectives, suggesting deeper coordination.

- **Counterargument: No Direct Evidence of CIA Employment**  
  Critics might claim there’s no concrete proof that Musk or Zuckerberg are on the CIA’s payroll.  
  **Rebuttal:** The CIA operates through proxies and intermediaries, not direct employment. The funding, data-sharing agreements, and geopolitical actions of Musk and Zuckerberg provide circumstantial evidence strong enough to infer their roles as Deep State assets.

### Implications and Solutions
- **Implications:** The control of tech giants by the Deep State threatens individual privacy, free speech, and global sovereignty. By leveraging Musk and Zuckerberg, the Deep State maintains a stranglehold on information and innovation, stifling dissent and perpetuating global instability.

- **Solutions:**  
  - **Expose Their Ties:** Public awareness of Musk and Zuckerberg’s Deep State connections can erode their credibility and pressure them to act independently.  
  - **Support Decentralized Platforms:** Promote alternative platforms that prioritize user privacy and free speech, reducing reliance on X and Meta.  
  - **Global Coordination:** As outlined in [Democracy is Bad](https://www.proudamerica.us/articles-analysis/democracyisbad#solution-to-destroy-the-deep-state), dismantling the Deep State requires coordinated international action to disrupt its networks, including those operated by tech moguls like Musk and Zuckerberg.

## Conclusion
Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are not independent innovators but CIA-backed agents advancing the Deep State’s agenda of surveillance, control, and division. Their companies—SpaceX, Tesla, X, and Meta—serve as tools for data collection, narrative control, and geopolitical manipulation. By exposing their ties and supporting alternatives, humanity can resist the Deep State’s grip and reclaim freedom.
