Democracy is a fraud controlled by the Deep State, an international terrorist group orchestrating wars and manipulating elections to maintain global dominance.

<!-- truncate -->

## Why is democracy a bad thing?

### The Deep State - Introduction
The Deep State is the international terrorist organization that orchestrates wars to rule the world.

### How to recognize The Deep State?

They have different names, but you can recognize them by their accusations whenever someone challenges them. They typically accuse others of racism, anti-Semitism, and xenophobia, and they ridicule their opponents by calling them killers, nazis, russia or chiniense agents or clowns, enemies of the state or democracy, and other derogatory terms.

### The proof that feminists are tools of the deep state is that they ignore Joanna Darc, who spoke out against the deep state.

### Bad actions.

An example is the Democrats' bad actions during World War II, including their attack on the weapons factories owned by the [racist's] Henry Ford, which contributed to the weakening of America. Another instance is the ridicule from the student community of a publication in The New York Times by a young American student about fuel and rocket engines from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, which were later used by Wernher von Braun, the Nazi leader who became a key figure at NASA.
 
The greatest fraud in democracy is the election of the president, which only gives people the impression that they have influence over the fate of the country and themselves.
As seen, Trump lost the last election. He also had limited opportunities during his term, as he had to yield to the Deep State institutions that opposed him. Pseudo-Republicans have no influence; they are outvoted every time. The voting system remains intact and dormant, giving Trump little chance of winning the next election, and even if he does, even less chance of changing anything for the better. The Marxist Deep State is not solely an American institution but an international one.

### Proof that Democrats are Racists & Nazis & Communists
First of all Americans didn’t invent slavery. It was the Danes [Danish Slave Trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_slave_trade), whose racist mainstream media they support. The proof lies in the Democrats, modern owners of modern slaves, i.e., the owners of foundations, mainly democratic ones, and their dogs, i.e., volunteers, as well as Black and democratic owners of Chinese slaves who support communism and exploit modern Chinese slaves—people working for a bowl of rice in shoe factories like NIKE and LeBron James introducing communist socialism, which caused the collapse of the greatest country in the world, namely the USA, as well as Venezuela and whole Europe. Stalin and Hitler also introduced socialism under the guise of democracy, women’s equality, and their glorification, after which he turned all people into slaves and led to the downfall of Germany, greater than after the First World War.

Germany has invaded other countries for centuries, just like the Japanese. As Jesus said: "He who lives by the sword, dies by the sword." They understood the consequences of attempting to conquer the world during the First World War, and the German people supported the actions of their government at the time. Thank God they lost, and they all should have faced death for such an attempt. However, they were instead punished with starvation, though the control over this punishment was too weak. This country should have been forgotten for such an attempt, just like the Japanese. Yet, the kindness of America knows no bounds—though this does not apply to America's borders, because without borders, there is no safety for its citizens, and anyone who claims otherwise is an unknowing traitor, or simply a traitor.

### How to destroy The Deep State?

[Clown] Napoleon lost to the Deep State due to the lack of coordination among his forces and their inability to mobilize effectively. To defeat the global Deep State, coordinated actions on an international level are necessary.

In 1307, King Philip IV of France orchestrated the mass arrests of the Templars. Deeply in debt to the order, Philip IV turned against the [Heretics] Templars, as well as other legitimate rulers, and even Pope Clement V. Under pressure from the king, the pope suspended the activities of the order in 1312.

## Solution to destroy The Deep State.

Coordinate global action and refrain from giving money to the Deep State.
