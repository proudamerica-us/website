### Necton - The Predatory Mechanisms of the Deep State Across More Than Two Centuries

The Deep State has always played the long game, using time like a tool—just look at IBM and the symbolism of the clock. It draws inspiration from ancient systems of manipulation, exploitation, and enslavement, most notably Ancient Egypt.

Throughout history, the Deep State has robbed individuals of their work and inventions. Nikola Tesla, for instance, was allegedly stripped of his innovations by more connected figures like Edison—who, unlike the immigrant Tesla, had privileged access to elite networks.

### Modern Times

Elon Musk, an immigrant without established connections—much like Tesla—invested $6 million and acquired the rights to Tesla Motors from its original founders, Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. The founders chose a lower-risk path by selling rather than investing themselves. Musk, on the other hand, believed in the American Dream, accepted the risks, and backed the company fully.

In late 2024, Musk was accused of misleading the public by implying he founded Tesla. He later explained that the original founders were unwilling to take financial risks, which left him as the true driving force behind the company. These accusations were likely supported by the Deep State in an attempt to discredit Musk—formerly a Democrat—who had since turned against them.

### Origins

The origins of the Deep State date back to Ancient Egypt and the eternal struggle between good and evil. “Good” is often falsely defined by the Deep State as what benefits the collective—when in truth, the collective is composed of individuals, and individual good must come first.

Education is the key to freedom and prosperity. But for the Deep State, knowledge is to be hoarded and only given to the obedient few who seek control over others. True education raises living standards and expectations—but power structures resist that.

Ptolemy founded the Library of Alexandria to preserve and distribute educational literature freely. But like other forces of knowledge, it was destroyed—allegedly by Lucius Domitius Aurelian—just as Wikipedia today is manipulated by biased editing and deletion to serve certain narratives.

Throughout history, religion has been used to divide people into "the faithful" (who accept control) and "the pagans" (who seek education). Pagans were often demonized and killed—just like the Inquisition did to freethinkers. These methods, aimed at voluntary subjugation, have been honed over thousands of years by the Deep State.

The Catholic Church opposed educational literature and technological advancement, even burning people alive for promoting ideas like Gutenberg's printing press.

### Propaganda and Polarization: Always Effective

People can be polarized for any reason: height, race, nationality, religion, sexuality, education. These divisions are exploited to maintain control and reinforce the Deep State's power. Those with connections to this hidden elite gain access to information that keeps others enslaved.

Oil only gains importance when paired with combustion engines—giving nations an edge in war. But water is essential to survival.

King William IV of England helped popularize Schweppes, supposedly for inventing carbonation. But in truth, the invention came from **Joseph Priestley** and **William Brownrigg**, who were never compensated. Schweppes, backed by the Deep State, still uses misinformation to cloud the truth.

- [Who invented soda water?](https://sodasense.com/blogs/bubbly-blog/who-invented-soda-water)
- [Health effects of carbonated water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonated_water)

Carbonated water, while seemingly harmless, is classified in the U.S. as having minimal nutritional value—even when vitamins or sweeteners are added.

> "Indian Tonic Water" was created to treat malaria among British colonists in India. The name itself ties back to colonialism, not innovation or health.

Schweppes promotes a false image of wellness while selling a product that once treated colonial soldiers—not civilians. Coca-Cola now owns Schweppes in many regions and continues the misinformation.

#### Deeper Into the Bottle

The real problem isn’t just the unpaid inventors or colonist agendas—it's the ongoing culture of **modern slavery**. The Deep State sells “freedom” through branding while hiding the true costs.

I stopped drinking soda years ago—not because I read it was unhealthy, but because I *felt* worse after drinking it. Once I quit, I felt better. Now, I drink only still water.

Schweppes contains carbohydrates and sugar—two ingredients directly tied to incurable diseases like cancer.

Even sports are manipulated. The NBA promotes vitamin water. Red Bull markets energy drinks to children while wrapping itself in charity events like *Wings For Life*—a race that has shown no significant scientific progress in over 12 years.

#### Deep State vs. Donald Trump

Donald Trump, a major opponent of the Deep State, was accused of failing to meet promises in his first 100 days. But the Deep State has operated not for decades or centuries—but for **millennia**—and now controls institutions like the WHO and most global organizations.

Cancer research is an example. Billions are raised for "research" that only Deep State-controlled entities can conduct. This creates a monopoly on both funds and knowledge, slowing down progress while enriching insiders.

#### Schweppes Commercial Propaganda: Women in Space

Schweppes recently released a commercial glorifying women astronauts—an attempt to overshadow Elon Musk and replace him with Jeff Bezos by fully co-opting SpaceX and social influence. CO2 in water is still okay for Deep State while it's earn money.

**Alexander Kenanov**, CEO of B2Y Productions, is likely a Deep State agent involved in the production of manipulative media. His films have seen declining success, yet he’s favored by elite groups to push narratives.

#### Connections Behind the Schweppes Ad:

- **Companies:** FIFA, FIA, Hublot, Warner Bros, BBC, Victoria’s Secret  
- **Countries:** Bulgaria, Switzerland, USA, UK, China  
- **Key Roles:**
  - Director: Susanna White

Bulgarians—including Orthodox Christians and Muslims—have historically exploited the weak. In Poland (1990–2000), disabled people were forced to beg in major cities. Roadside prostitution and connections with Russia and the Deep State, especially Democrats in the USA and UK, reinforce this pattern.


#### Conclusions.

The methodology of the Deep State is primarily based on identifying threats and eliminating them. They only use the law after exploiting a legal loophole that they themselves left open for their own purposes. Then they block those practices, removing the threat and opening new doors to serve their material needs.

The Deep State loses influence without money. The slaves, now called “volunteers,” work only for a short period of time because they too need to eat — and the Deep State merely uses and exploits them (read: Modern Slavery).

The Deep State takes advantage of the short human memory, limited by illness and, most of all, the length of life. Despite the vast funds gathered for research, we are now experiencing a rise in amnesia and similar memory-limiting diseases. The sale and advertisement of unhealthy food products, especially in the most powerful country — the USA — is a deliberate act by the Deep State, causing people to forget about the Deep State and surrender.

Those who once fought back, after a life lesson, teach their children that it’s better to submit to the Deep State in order to have a better life, a happy family, and a safe home (guaranteed by the Deep State).

It’s worth accepting that we are dominated by the Deep State, that we are slaves — and, most importantly, that we can’t do anything about it, even though there are more ordinary good people than bad ones, and they could overthrow the Deep State within a few years.
