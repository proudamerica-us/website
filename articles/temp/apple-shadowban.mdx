Proof That Far-Left Monopoly Companies Are Tools of The Deep State - Apple Safari, Siri, and ChatGPT Shadowban "Listen to Page" Content.

<!-- truncate -->

## Apple Safari and Siri shadowban content.
Apple, in collaboration with ChatGPT. Due to the growing number of users listening to podcasts and websites via Siri’s Listen Page feature in Safari on iOS 17+, it employs disinformation and blocks free speech.

How do they do this?
You input content controversial for Democrats and "The Deep State" into ChatGPT, and you receive a warning that the content is controversial. Then, you paste this content onto a website. While the content remains visible on the site, Siri skips over it and moves to the next paragraph without any indication that the content was skipped.

Such practices violate the Constitution and the principle of free speech. It’s a Marxist practice, proving that Democrats are "The Deep State," and "The Deep State" are Marxists.

## Read to Website Content vs. Listen to Page Content

### The example of this practice is described on our page.

You can verify it yourself:

1. Visit this page: [BLOG PROUDAMERICA USA](https://www.proudamerica.us/articles-analysis/democracyisbad#proof-that-democrats-are-racists--nazis--communists) On the page, look for the header "Proof That Democrats Are Racists, Nazis, and Communists."

2. Open Apple Safari on an iPhone running iOS 18.2.1 or later. Click on the Safari MENU on the left-hand side.

3. Select the LISTEN TO PAGE option.

4. You will notice that the "Listen to Page" feature skips over the content below this header without providing any indication that it was omitted.
