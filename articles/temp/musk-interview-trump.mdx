## Elon Musk interviews Donald Trump on X

On August 12, 2024, Elon Musk interviewed former President Donald Trump on X, amassing over 1.2 million listeners despite technical difficulties, including a 40-minute delay due to a reported DDOS attack. The two-hour conversation covered a range of topics, with a significant focus on the recent assassination attempt on Trump.

### Trump Recounts Assassination Attempt
Trump described the incident in Butler, Pennsylvania, where a bullet pierced the upper part of his right ear. He credited his survival to a last-second head tilt to the right while referencing a chart on illegal immigration, a move he said was prompted by the crowd's reaction to the chart. Trump noted that the bullet missed his skull by a quarter of an inch, and had he not turned, it would have been fatal. He also mentioned a second chart on illegal immigrant crime that he never got to display due to the attack.

"I didn’t even know there was a bullet flying at me because I was talking," Trump said, emphasizing the narrow escape. He also praised the Secret Service snipers for their quick response in neutralizing the shooter, who was later confirmed dead, though Trump noted he was not allowed to discuss the assailant due to an ongoing FBI investigation.

### Other Topics Discussed
- **Climate Change:** Trump expressed skepticism about climate change, calling it "nuclear warming" and suggesting that rising sea levels could create "more oceanfront property." Musk countered by advocating for sustainable energy, arguing that CO2 levels are a concern and that humanity should accelerate its transition to renewables like solar and wind.
  
- **Immigration:** Trump reiterated his hardline stance, focusing on the chart that he believes saved his life, which highlighted illegal immigration statistics. He blamed the Biden administration for lax border policies.

- **Economy and Jobs:** Trump touted his past economic record, claiming he created "the greatest economy in history" before the COVID-19 pandemic. Musk pressed him on inflation concerns, suggesting a need for balanced fiscal policies.

- **Foreign Policy:** Trump criticized the handling of the Ukraine-Russia conflict, claiming he could broker peace "in 24 hours" by pressuring both sides. Musk agreed that the war has been a "meat grinder" and supported de-escalation.

### Technical Issues and Public Reaction
The interview faced significant hurdles, starting 40 minutes late due to what Musk described as a "massive DDOS attack on X." Some users on X reported issues accessing the stream, though others suggested the platform’s infrastructure might have been overwhelmed by the unprecedented listener count. Despite the rocky start, the event garnered significant attention, with clips circulating widely across social media.

Public reaction was polarized. Supporters of Trump and Musk praised the unfiltered format, with one X user posting, "This is what free speech looks like—Musk and Trump speaking directly to the people without mainstream media spin." Critics, however, called it a "propaganda fest," pointing to Trump’s unchallenged claims and Musk’s relatively soft questioning style. A post on X from a verified account read, "Musk gave Trump a free pass to spew nonsense about climate and immigration—disappointing for a supposed truth-seeker."

### Context and Significance
This interview marked a notable moment in the 2024 election cycle, with Trump leveraging X to reach a massive audience ahead of the Republican National Convention. Musk’s involvement underscored his growing political influence, especially after his recent endorsement of Trump following the assassination attempt. The event also highlighted X’s role as a platform for unmoderated political discourse, raising questions about its impact on public opinion as the election nears.
