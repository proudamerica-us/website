## The Democratic Biden pardons innocent individuals

Thereby depriving them of the opportunity to defend themselves in court, violating the Equal Protection Clause (14th Amendment):
Text: "No state shall... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."
Purpose: This clause mandates equal treatment of all individuals under the law. It is a key element in civil rights cases, addressing discrimination based on race, gender, and ***other factors***.

The same illegal practice took place in Poland when President Duda pardoned individuals who had not been convicted by a court.

## Threat to global Democracy:

Such practices grant unconvicted but pardoned individuals the right/ability to stand above the law in the future and avoid accountability for crimes they may commit. This is inconsistent with every constitution in the world and violates civil rights, accountability, and the principle of equality among all citizens of so-called democratic countries. Such practices are evidence that these countries are, in fact, totalitarian since they allow certain individuals to stand above the law.

***This violates the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and fundamental principles of justice and equality:***

1. Equal Protection Clause (14th Amendment): Ensures equal treatment of all individuals under the law.
2. Due Process Clauses (5th and 14th Amendments): Guarantee fair judicial proceedings and prevent arbitrary decisions.
3. Judicial Power (Article III, Section 2): Mandates that legal and equity-related matters must be resolved within the judicial system.
4. Privileges or Immunities Clause (14th Amendment): Protects the fundamental rights of citizens and prevents unequal treatment.

## The Deep State - Summary and conclusions.

### The use of this criminal practice in two democratic countries proves that these actions are coordinated by the Deep State.

### Such actions caused genocide (Fake Chinese "Dr. Fauci's Covid") without the possibility of convicting those responsible for crimes against humanity, and they must be punished with the harshest penalty.
