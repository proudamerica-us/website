The Polish Deep State — namely USAID, Warner Bros, and Disney — did indeed pull funds from the Warsaw Stock Exchange, not only out of fear of losing their assets, but also to fuel anti-Trump sentiment and punish him, along with the party that supports him, ahead of the presidential elections (PiS; a socialist opposition party that’s no different from the current ruling party, KO. The KO government backed COVID measures and profited from USAID, while PiS also profited — not directly, but through COVID Hoax restrictions. PiS supports Trump more than it supports Poles, as seen during the enforcement of total COVID lockdowns, including a ban on leaving one’s home).

### Head politicians of the Deep State in Poland:

```1. Mateusz Morawiecki``` - PiS Party; fake Jews who became Christians for money and power.

Polish Former Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and the Deep State banker who used his influence to make a fortune in real estate while serving as Prime Minister during COVID. In return, he repaid the Deep State by turning a blind eye to the illegal practices of Santander Bank and the exploitation of their clients — his own people.

Santander Bank, during the epidemic state, applied unfair market practices towards its clients, which involved including provisions in annexes and standard application forms filled out by consumers, related to the deferral of repayment terms for loans denominated or indexed to a foreign currency.

At the same time, he allowed the legislative process to slow down and let criminal cases drag on until they expired or were postponed for years — effectively placing banks above the very people who make their existence possible. He did this because he was working for the Deep State, just like the current Prime Minister of Poland, Donald Tusk, who is now serving his second term.

```2. Donald Tusk``` - Polish Prime Minister, KO Party;

When Tusk was appointed by the Deep State, his very first trip was to New York to meet with the Deep State elite — namely, New York Jews. After his first term and unfulfilled promises, he became Prime Minister again thanks to USAID funding. Between his terms, the Deep State rewarded him with the position of President of the European Council — a role that holds no real power beyond the paycheck and media spotlight.

Now let's get back to business.
After the withdrawals, the index of the 20 largest companies on the exchange dropped only by a 6 percent while German DAX was 10 percent.

PAP – the Polish Press Agency, which turned out to be a puppet of the Deep State.

Fearing further declines after buying the shares back, the Deep State suspended trading — making the Warsaw Stock Exchange the only one in the world to take such action — under the pretense of "security concerns."

The largest bank in Poland, PKO BP — which is in the hands of the Deep State — experienced operational issues in the morning. The bank refused to explain what had happened, merely denying that it was a hacker attack.

In short: the Deep State pulled money from shareholders, shut down the free market, and offered no valid justification for the so-called “security concern,” especially since no other exchange took similar action.

In fear of public backlash and further questions, the Polish Press Agency (PAP) — the official government news outlet — began using redirects instead of actual translations on its website to obscure the truth, all under the guise of “security risks," hiding truth for English speakers and analysis providers, see:

Proof that the Deep State in Poland has ties to Google is the masking of indices on Google Finance, which is the fastest way to check market information, including long-term indices.

At the same time, they TVN24 TV part of Warner Bros. abruptly stopped publishing daily updates on the war in Ukraine, just as they had done on the final day of the COVID hoax — proving that the Deep State in Poland runs on the same engine as the global Deep State, i.e., the U.S. Democrats.

## Diving deeper reveals connections that aren't obvious at first glance.

### Deep State Market Schema Playbook

1. Sell out.
2. Wait for the drop.
3. Observe other markets — watch what the global Deep State is doing elsewhere; it's a stress test.
4. Buy back in — if others do.
5. Create confusion using the largest bank; use public fake news as a backup if needed.
6. Halt the stock market — losses are not an option.
7. If it drops: sell instantly. If not: sell the next day.
8. Repeat.
9. Expansion into other markets

On April 7, 2025, the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) in Poland was the only stock market explicitly confirmed to have halted trading today based on official reports. The WSE suspended trading on all markets from 3:15 PM to 4:15 PM CEST (1:15 PM to 2:15 PM GMT) due to an overwhelming volume of brokerage orders that risked destabilizing the trading system, amid significant global market volatility. Trading resumed at 4:30 PM CEST.
While posts on X mention additional markets—such as China, Taiwan, Japan, Australia, Singapore, and Russell 2000 futures—hitting circuit breakers or being suspended due to sharp declines, these claims lack specific, verifiable confirmation from official sources for today’s date. Global market turmoil, driven by factors like U.S. tariffs and retaliatory measures, has indeed triggered widespread volatility, and circuit breakers could have been activated in various markets to pause trading temporarily. However, without precise timestamps or official announcements tied to April 7, 2025, for these other markets, the WSE remains the only definitively documented case of a trading halt today.

The biggest bank in Poland is PKO Bank Polski (Powszechna Kasa Oszczędności Bank Polski S.A.), commonly known as PKO BP. It is the largest financial institution in the country by total assets, which exceeded 501 billion Polish zloty (PLN) in 2023. Founded in 1919, PKO BP has grown to dominate the Polish banking sector, holding a leading market share in deposits (around 17.9%) and loans (approximately 17.7%). It serves over 9 million individual and business customers through an extensive network of more than 1,200 branches and thousands of ATMs across Poland. The bank is headquartered in Warsaw and is listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, with the Polish state holding a significant stake (29.43% directly via the State Treasury as of recent data)

There is no definitive evidence that PKO BP's banking systems were completely offline today, April 7, 2025. However, based on available information, it’s possible you’re referring to issues related to broader market disruptions or specific technical difficulties. The Warsaw Stock Exchange, which is closely tied to Poland’s financial ecosystem including major banks like PKO BP, suspended trading for an hour today from 3:15 PM to 4:15 PM CEST due to an overwhelming volume of brokerage orders that threatened the stability of its trading system. This occurred amidst significant global market volatility, which could have indirectly impacted banking operations or customer access to financial services.
Regarding PKO BP specifically, there’s no official report of a full system outage today. However, posts on X and other sources suggest that PKO BP has experienced intermittent service disruptions in the past, often tied to scheduled maintenance or unexpected technical issues. For instance, a post from Telepolis.pl today at 8:54 AM CEST mentioned "short-term but inconvenient disruptions" at PKO BP, though it didn’t specify a complete shutdown. Without more detailed, official confirmation from PKO BP, it’s unclear if their banking systems were fully offline or if they faced partial disruptions, possibly exacerbated by the market instability affecting Poland’s financial sector today.

The Polish stock market, specifically the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE), suspended trading on all markets today, April 7, 2025, from 1:15 PM GMT to 2:15 PM GMT (3:15 PM to 4:15 PM CEST). This one-hour halt was implemented due to concerns over the "security of trading." The decision came amidst significant global market volatility, with the WSE's blue-chip WIG20 index dropping as much as 7% during the day and stabilizing at a 2% decline just before the suspension. The exchange later clarified that the pause was triggered by an overwhelming volume of brokerage orders that risked destabilizing the trading system. This action coincided with broader international market turmoil, including a sharp decline in Wall Street at the U.S. market open, reflecting heightened investor caution and instability. Trading resumed at 2:30 PM GMT (4:30 PM CEST) without extending the session, indicating an attempt to manage risk while maintaining market operations.

### Bloomberg experts love pointed this out.
"I based my opinion on the best expert advice" ~Phillip Franklin, White Star Line Vice President

The financial advantage between decent people and fraudsters will always favor the fraudsters. No fees for anything, embezzling from decent people, and unchecked trafficking in humans, organs, money laundering, drugs, and weapons has created such a disparity that if they ever pay it all out, the Swiss franc will double against the dollar. There’s a higher chance that the franc will hold and the dollar will fall if the Deep State is not held accountable. Unless we start selling natural resources like Russia — which are limited — unlike corruption and service provisions that are protected by the confidentiality of Swiss bank client data.
The only advantage honest and hard-working people have over high-ranking (government-level) fraudsters is their numbers and freedom of choice — the military and police who catch thieves, murderers, and organized crime groups and put them in prison, instead of focusing on something else, because nothing else will work.
